Rough draft of Thesis Project

Goal: Write code to make IUCN data more accessible and analyze synergetic threats.
Brief Background: Amphibains are rapidly disappearing. IUCN is the most trusted site for endangered species data. By writing code 
to make amphibain data more accessible, more effort can be put into conserving amphiabians. After data has been collected, it is 
well known that amphibains are under attack in mutliple ways (habitat destruction, climate change, etc.). While there 
is a need to know how these threats interact (and what combination drives amphibians to extinction), little research
has been conducted on synergistic threats. 

This project will focus on Latin America (biodiversity hotspot) and SE Asia as case studies. Threat data, IUCN status, etc., will be
collected and analyzed to potentially inform conservation policies. 

Main Questions (To be completed for Latin America Amphibainans and SE Asia amphibains): 
- What is the most lethal threat combination?
- What threats occur together the most? 
- Is there a relationship between threat status and endangerment level (i.e. most critically endangered amphibians have chytrid fungus)?
- By plotting threats on a map by species range, what insights can we infer? (GIS component) 

Three main folders: 
(1) Code: scripting docs 
(2) Data: all data collected (i.e. threat status, threat type, etc.) 
(3) Reports: previously compiled data analysis reports for projects, class, etc.
